# Age-Related-Shifts-in-Autobiographical-Memory-Evidence-from-Naturalistic-Vacation-Reviews

This repository hosts the R code used to analyze a dataset of 377,477 German vacation reviews, investigating age-related changes in autobiographical memory. The study employs a novel, fully automated linguistic method to quantify episodic and semantic content in naturalistic contexts. The code includes the analysis for operationalizing episodic memory through word count and semantic memory through average word length, revealing how age-related shifts in memory detail—specifically a decrease in episodic content and an increase in semantic abstraction—mirror findings from lab-based autobiographical memory studies. Due to a non-disclosure agreement with the data provider, the data cannot be shared. However, a Shiny application that reproduces all outputs from the paper is available at https://www.unilu.ch/en/faculties/overview/professorships/prof-dr-leif-brandes. The repository contains the full statistical analysis code and methods for reproducing the reported findings.
